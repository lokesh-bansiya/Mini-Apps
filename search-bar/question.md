# Assignment
 - Create a search bar. User should be able to search for a country by name:

 - use https://github.com/samayo/country-json
 - use https://github.com/samayo/country-json/blob/master/src/country-by-capital-city.json
 - you can use mock server to manage this
 - use throttling to manage the search bar (create a useEffect) ( we will discuss this later in a PSC, so  
 -  dont worry if you do not get this part )
 - create a drop down below the search bar
 - it should provide partial matches or matches of the search against the list of countries
 - use a simple substring check
 - limit the responses to 5 on drop down ( in view, use css to hide )
 - on hover you should highlight
 - on bring up a modal and show the country (as title) and capital as body
 - example
 - Use Hooks
 - show an activity indicator on the right when the query is happening ( can add a fake delay to emulate an api )
 - other features
 - use arrow keys to let user move from top to bottom
 - if user reaches the 6th selection, then the results should be from 2,3,4,5,6. 1 is hidden.
 - and only when the user moves from 2 to up it should show the first selection
 - use throttling
 - by pressing enter or onClick you should move to a page (dynamic routing) and show that data with a back button
